# ✅ FullScreenDialog

This project was implemented relying on the Android full-screen dialog in [Material Design](https://material.io/components/dialogs), 
as described in the Material Design tutorial. It's a simple fullScreen Loader AlertDialog.

With beautiful designs, you can open up new horizons every day by offering innovative and thoughtful 
concepts through creative tools, one of which is the customizable **UI** dialog design.
